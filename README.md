# Cookpal Web Application

Cookpal is a web application developed as a project for our web assignment in the first year. It is built using React+Vite for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. Cookpal provides a platform for users to explore various recipes, including premium features, and offers functionalities such as user authentication, login, and signup.

    Once the JSON Server and React app are running, you can access Cookpal by opening a web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

## Future Plans

Currently, Cookpal utilizes Firebase for authentication, and we plan to fully host the application on Firebase in the future. Additionally, we aim to implement more features and enhancements to enrich the user experience.
